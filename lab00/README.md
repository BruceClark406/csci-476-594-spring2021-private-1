## Task 1: Confirming My Questionnaire Response

_...summary of the purpose of the task/question..._  

_...solution / code snippets / screenshots / other evidence..._  

_...observations / conclusions..._  

Here is an example of including an image in my submission:

I'm using Markdown's simply syntax to include an image that is stored in the same folder as this `README.md`.
You can also use the HTML `img` tag if you need to be a bit more expressive in how your image is included.

## Task 2: A Demo of Tasks with SubTasks

### Task 2(a): A Meaningful SubTask Title

_...summary of the purpose of the task/question..._  

_...solution / code snippets / screenshots / other evidence..._

### Task 2(b): A Meaningful SubTask Title

_...summary of the purpose of the task/question..._  

_...solution / code snippets / screenshots / other evidence..._
